#About Project

First project using API, and get data from NY Times. Learning how to get json file, and using data, showing information in HTML.

Also, practising making mobile first website. Breakpoint: min-width 600px for tablet, and min-width 1000px for desktop.

And some JavaScript to show animation. Like loading gif show/hide, abstract show/hide, and fail information show/hide.
