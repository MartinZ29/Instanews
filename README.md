First project using API, and get data from NY Times. Learning how to get json file, and using data, showing information in HTML.

Also, practising making mobile first website. Breakpoint: min-width 600px for tablet, and min-width 1000px for desktop.

And some JavaScript to show animation. Like loading gif show/hide, abstract show/hide when mouse enter of leave, and fail information show/hide.
